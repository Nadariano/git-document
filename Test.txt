Hello Git! â˜º

***Notes:
1. When a new branch created, a pointer will be stuck onto the latest commit that you're on.
2. When checkout to another branch, the HEAD will point to that branch.
	(Ex: Jumping from branch 'main' to 'testing': <git checkout/switch testing> => HEAD -> (main, testing))
 2.1. When want to both create a new branch and checkout to it right away, use [git branch -b xxx]
 2.2. When want to back to the previous branch, use [git checkout/switch -]
